Ad Text New-York City. Staten Island. October 22. National Day of Protest to stop
Police Brutality. The day when everyone must stand up for their rights in the
City where "We can't breath" movement was created after Eric Garner's death.

Mr. Garner and his family paid a horrible price to make us all realize that
we're in danger. Eric will never be forgotten. The crimes of police officers will
never be forgotten as well. Police brutality in this country is unacceptable and
must be stopped!

Join us, show your support and solidarity. On October 22 we will meet at the
place where Mr. Garner was killed.

202 Bay Street, Staten Island, New York, 2 pm. National Day of Protest.
