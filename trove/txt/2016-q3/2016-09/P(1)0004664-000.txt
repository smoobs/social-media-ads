Ad Text The story of Leon Ford is shocking sad and gives hope at the same time. This
brave activist uses his personal experience to inspire others and fight against
police brutality. On November 12, 2012, Leon Ford was pulled over by a
Pittsburgh cop for what appeared to be a routine traffic stop. His life has never
been the same since then. Leon Ford: Activating Minds of Those Who are
