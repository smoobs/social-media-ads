Ad Text Border Patrol agents in South Texas arrested an illegal alien from Honduras
that had previously been deported and convicted of Rape Second Degree.
Thanks to Obama's and Hillary's policy, illegals come here because they wait
for amnesty promised. The wrong course had been chosen by the American
government; but all those politicians are too far from the border to see who
actually sneaks through it illegally.
Rapists, drug dealers, human traffickers; and others. The percent of innocent
poor families searching for a better life is too small to become an argument for
amnesty and Texas warm welcome.
