Ad Text Do you know that the white Milwuakee officer who was fired from his job after
fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This
is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without
prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black
person’s life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the
second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired.
It is now absolutely Clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led
to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.
