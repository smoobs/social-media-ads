Ad Text 8 August, 1974 Republican President Richard M. Nixon resigned. With
impeachment proceedings underway against him for his involvement in the
Watergate affair, Nixon was finally bowing to pressure from the public and
Congress to leave the White House.

Many people asked themselves: “How dare he to do that?”

This is the awful part of our history, however, the similar actions still happen
during current campaign: deleted emails, accident with Bernie Sanders and

the DNC... This is bad and nobody cares. Does the political hypocrisy jump at
the high level nowadays?
