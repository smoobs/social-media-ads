Ad Text "If you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do l have a problem when a
sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many
millions of dollars from foreign governments, many governments which are

dictatorships... yeah, I do," Sanders said in an interview with Jake Tapper on
CNN.

So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent
opinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the "second Democratic
option". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than
an "organized crime" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'
money!

Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like
Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that
abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged
feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries
that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary
has always been a "defender" of the minorities.

So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.
What's your opinion on that point?
