Ad Text LGBT community is suffering from haters and especially hate religious
groups! These crazy thugs should be jailed for life!

Crystal Raquel Cash, 55, cannot speak but is alive after being shot nearly
point blank in the face by a member of Christian hate group.

The attacker, Gerald Duane Lewis, 26, and his wife reportedly are members
of the Israel United in Church, which the Southern Poverty Law Center listed
as a hate group last year. According to the newspapers, Lewis was wearing a
shirt from the Church when he opened fire, shouting a homophobic slur.

The government must pay more attention to assaults on sexual minorities
because this is the threat to the country’s internal security!
