Ad Text Clinton said the United States needs to confront the ‘systematic racism’ in its
law enforcement efforts. We’re sick of politicians organizing and leading the
systematical propaganda against our police. It is unfair and vilely to accuse

our heroes of every sin and crime.

In fact, the efficiency of our cops resulted in a decrease of the average
amount of crimes, especially in large Cities. Law-abiding Citizens should never
fear cops, but criminals do. And that’s why Hillary is on the criminals’ side.

Join our rally on July, 23th in New York City, it's time to show Clinton that we
will never let her become our next President!
