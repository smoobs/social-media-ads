ﬂ'hama is a totaJl hypocrite and a liar! He visited the Dallas mamnrtal service:
tn blame us at racism. He just had to turn a aeramar‘ry honoring the fallen
ofﬁcers mm a disgraceful. He doesn‘t care about fallen ofﬁcers! Dbama is
not our Iaader!

Texans have already honured our heroes, laying ﬂowers at. Dallas patina
headquarters. But Dhama‘s speech did not make Sense at all. That's Why we
have to support all police officers whn refused tn appilaucl Obama.

Taking sides with these riatars and racists, Ghama [literally called for open
war against police ofﬁcers and whites. He name there and ha lectured
ofﬁcers who are targeted every day for assassinatian by Black Lives Matter
that the}:r need tn change. Kick this asshnle cut at Texas!
