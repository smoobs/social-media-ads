Soml'timas penplée say I nritizc-ivza the gwnmrnment 1cm much. They Say I can‘t
see positive moments. In fact, I see alll guard things in the United States, and
I'm proud to be an American. But [ radian that Ican’I have 1113 ﬁg ht to Heap
silwzence when outrageous things happen.

I can't Keep silence while stupid idiots fnrb‘id nur children tn wear patrimic
cimhes. I can’t keep silence while Obama creates cnmfnrtab‘le conditinns fur
terrorists, acmming of 1U,ﬂﬂﬂ Syrian refugees. I can‘t keep silence while
liberals spit on the U.S. Constitution.

Yes, I criticize everything what is unacceptable for the nation" If Americans
tum a blind eye to outrageous things, anjaying only positive moments of their
¥in38, we will never live better. Criticism is a way fur devalnpment. I'm a
patriot. that's why .I criticize.
