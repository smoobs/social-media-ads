Ad Text Come and show on which side you are in the fight against police brutality.

Please, join families of people killed by law enforcement at the National Day
of Protest Against Police Brutality on October 22. 956 people were killed by
police in 2015, and at least 161 of them were unarmed. We all witness justice
being gone from this country, and we all understand: each of these stolen
lives must never be forgotten.

October 22 is a day when thousands of people throughout the country can
join forces to express their outrage, sorrow and resistance as a response to
the brutality of this system.

October 22 is time to show that we all have an opinion, it’s time to fight back.
