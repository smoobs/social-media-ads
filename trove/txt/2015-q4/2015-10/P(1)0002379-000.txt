Ad Text Common response after the massacre in Oregon is ‘I Want to Have a Gun’.

“I want to have a gun in the house to protect myself, to protect the people I’m
with. I’m sure I’ll have a normal life and never have to go through anything
like this, but I want to be sure,” said Mr. Vicari, 19.

The right to bear arms allows the people to protect themselves. Gun control
will deprive them this opportunity. And criminals will buy a firearm illegally. I
don’t know why some liberals are not able to understand it.

Anyway, patriots stand for the 2nd amendment. We will never allow them to
repeal or amend it!
