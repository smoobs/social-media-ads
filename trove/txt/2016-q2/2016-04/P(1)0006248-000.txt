Ad Text Another horrible loss!

Two beautiful and gifted young women were shot on Sunday in an apartment
complex parking lot near the LSU’s campus in Baton Rouge.

19 year old women were the Southern University Students.

Annette January was the freshman and a track start and the Lushantae
Benton was a sophomore and a highly regarded student-athlete trainer.

We send our deepest condolences to the January and Benton family.
