Ad Text The statistics show that nationwide 15 percent of Black students receive
suspensions, comparing with 4 percent of white students.
In some state, the numbers are even more disturbing. For example,
Wisconsin suspended 26.6 percent of Black students compared to the 3
percent of white students. Also in Minnesota, Connecticut, Iowa and
Nebraska black students were six times more likely than white students to be
suspended from school.
The racism in education is the reason why the school-to-prison pipeline
exists.
Our kids cannot even get a proper education, no wonder the success rate
among black students is low. Somehow white people still think that education
is only their privilege.
