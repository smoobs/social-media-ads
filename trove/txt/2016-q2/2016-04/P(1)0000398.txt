HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF
The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
had a °medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was
too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.
On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting
that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas,
was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his
son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken
to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his
combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour
later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
inmate.
Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were
followed.
We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after "fighting" with
the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
police custody.
