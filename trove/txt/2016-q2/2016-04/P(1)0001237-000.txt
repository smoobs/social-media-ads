Ad Text CHICAGO MAN SPENT1O YEARS IN PRISON ON DRUG CHARGES
BECAUSE COPS LIED UNDER OATH ABOUT THE CASE.

Jermaine Walker was arrested and sent to prison after the police officers and
a state’s attorney investigator had LIED UNDER OATH. They said that there
was no surveillance camera in the alley where they arrested him, even though
it was and Walker said that! It’s another prove that if you are black in this
country, you are never safe. You can be arrested killed or imprison |itera||y for
the color of your skin.

Walker’s attorney said that Walker can obtain up to $170,000 for the time he
spent in prison, but is it a good price for the 10 years of his life?!

These bastards ruined this man’s life and proved once again that there is not
justice in this country!
