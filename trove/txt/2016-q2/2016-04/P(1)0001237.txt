BECAUSE COPS LIED UNDER OATH ABOUT THE CASE.
Jermaine Walker was arrested and sent to prison after the police officers and
a state's attorney investigator had LIED UNDER OATH. They said that there
was no surveillance camera in the alley where they arrested him ; even though
it was and Walker said that! It's another prove that if you are black in this
country; you are never safe. You can be arrested killed or imprison literally for
the color of your skin.
Walker's attorney said that Walker can obtain up to $170,000 for the time he
spent in prison, but is it a good price for the 10 years of his life?!
These bastards ruined this man's life and proved once again that there is not
justice in this country!
