Ad Text A New Orleans judge ordered to release seven inmates awaiting trial because
the Louisiana doesn't have money to defend them. Some of them have spent
more than half a year awaiting a trial, but the city failed to provide the legal
help to them. Each year the budget is shredding, but the Louisiana remains
the state with the highest incarceration rate.
Each year the system incarcerates thousands of black men and women for
minor violations, but they let go the murderers and rapists. What is wrong with
our country???
