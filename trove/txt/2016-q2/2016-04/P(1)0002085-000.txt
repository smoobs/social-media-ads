Ad Text A rally in loving memory of Aiyana Jones

May 16 marked the sixth anniversary of the brutal slaying of 7-year-old Aiyana
Stanley-Jones by Detroit Police Officer Joe Weekley. She was shot by the
cop while she slept on a couch during a botched raid. The killer is still
employed by the Detroit Police Department. He was Charged with involuntary
manslaughter and two lesser Charges in her death, but the case was dropped

in January 2015.

Justice hasn’t been served for Aiyana and her grieving family.

We’re planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal
Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police
violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much
attention as possible to the lack ofjustice for the families of those who lost
their beloved ones at the hands of the police.

Invite everyone you know and join us on May 21.
We should stand up for the better future of our kids! The 6th Anniversary Of
The Aiyana Jones’ Death
