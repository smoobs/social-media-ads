Ad Text Hey, everyone!?
You know, a great number of black people support us saying that
#HillaryClintonlsNotMyPresident! So this time we would like to make a
#flashmob against #HillaryClinton because she is the real enemy of black
community and our followers prove it showing their disgrace to her personality
and policy. That's why we ask you to do the same and send your photos to
us. Why? Because we want to live in a better future and Hillary is not the
person who will help us in getting justice and peace by all means!
Dear followers, if you agree, just don't be ignorant to your future in America,
join our flashmob and take a photo with #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 or
#nohillary2016 and tag @blackmattersus!?
Looking forward to your photos?? BlackMattersUS AmericanCops
