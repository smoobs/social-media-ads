Ad Text 6 months into legal open carry in Texas: no problems reported. Democrats,
gunsense zealots, moms, students, professors and store owners told us that
open carry WOULD be a problem, but as it turned out, there wasn't any.
Yes, people are scared of people walking up carrying guns. But the truth is
they don't realize that there much more people who carry guns illegally. That's
why open carry is a guarantee of peace and stability in Texas.
