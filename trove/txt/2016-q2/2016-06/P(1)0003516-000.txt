Ad Text Rookie Florida cop arrested, fired after being caught on video beating up
handcuffed strip Club employee

Video shows probationary patrol officer Akinyemi Borisade repeatedly hitting
31-year-old Mayra Martinez on Wednesday at the Duval County jail.

Man, there were so many ways to fix the situation without resorting to use
excessive force. The worst part of it is how everyone just stands around
nonchalantly.? People who support cops and belive in good cops, please tell

me why the he“ a bunch of cops just stand and watch how another cop
beating a woman??? How???

How can we respect law enforcement, if they act like that? If you want my

respect, STOP SHOOTING AND BEATING THE CITIZENS YOU SWORE
TO PROTECT!!!
