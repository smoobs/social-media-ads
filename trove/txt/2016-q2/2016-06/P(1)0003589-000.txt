Ad Text #Chicago released hundreds of videos, audio recordings and documents

related to 101 pending investigations by the independent Police Review
Authority, which investigates police-involved incidents.

This is one of the videos that authorities have released. Though the video is a

Clear example of an excessive force, the report said that police officer had to
use his baton to protect himself.

Another cop was caught lying about the case. It’s not the first video that
proves that cops are lying bastards and it’s not the last. What they do is
systematically abusing people and then covering it with “I was feared for my

life” phrase. If it’s so scaring to be a police officer, may be they should find
another job?

What punishment do you think he deserves for that?!
