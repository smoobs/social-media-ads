Wikipedia: The term "semite"means a member of any of various ancient
and modern Semitic-speaking peoples originating in the Near East, including Hebrews (Israelites, Judeans and Samaritans). Bahranis. Maltese, Synacs and Arabs.
Jesus was a Hebrew who lived 2004 years ago in the Middle East.
He looked a hell of a lot
more like this

Than this

99% of people never moved further than maybe 100 miles from their
place of birth in their lifetimes - no-one knew what a Middle Eastern Jew
looked like, including the painters, who invented White Jesus so it would
be easier for people to identify with the Christ.
That's right. White Jesus is Bible fan-fiction.
