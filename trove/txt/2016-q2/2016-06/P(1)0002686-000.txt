Ad Text President Barack Obama defended his decision to open up bathrooms to
students of both sexes based on preference, Citing his religious faith as a
reason he decided to do it.

“My reading of scripture tells me that that [the] Golden Rule is pretty high up
there in terms of my Christian belief,” he said during a town hall in Elkhart,
Indiana.

Obama is nothing more than an ignoramus and provocateur shamelessly
mocking the Bible. Thanks God, the national nightmare is almost over. He
tries to create as many conflicts among the population as it's possible
destroying everything we hold of worth.
