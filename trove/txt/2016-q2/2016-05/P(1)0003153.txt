Ad Text Illegal immigrant invasion became the problem of gigantic proportions. More
than 18 million illegal immigrants are currently tearing America apart one
piece at a time. This unstoppable force is polluting our land, stealing our jobs
and receiving insane amounts money for that.
5% of population is committing 40% of all crimes in America. 65% of all drugs
are coming through the Mexican border. No good comes from these people.
Without them USA would be a lot better. It is just a simple fact.
