A very tnuchihg stunt. Roberta Gonzalaz. a dying Vietnam veteran fmm
Texas made this special request last weekend. Haspitali staf‘t and Htthertn's
tamin arranged his final meeting with two horses.

Gonzalez was paralyzed in 1v.4'iatr1earn diuiring {his service. He gave his haalﬂh

away in the- name at America like thausandfs at our brave sotdiiars did.

Unfortunately no DI'IB' can return their health and liuas back. Our best people
have to live the aharta'st iives. if {twhiy our Gavarnment could pay more
attention tn our heirues' ipmblisms tn make them a bit happier and to make
their hernia lives a hit lungavr.
