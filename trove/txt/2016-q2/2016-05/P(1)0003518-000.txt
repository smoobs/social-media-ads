Ad ID 1484

Ad Text State Police pulled Philadelphia attorney Rebecca Musarra over for allegedly
speeding on October 16, 2015. She refused to answer any questions and
they arrested her for obstruction of justice. She was later released without
being Charged for obstruct.

Americans have rights and one of them is the right to remain silent. We don't
have to answer your stupid interrogation questions. If we are speeding, tell us
we were stopped for speeding, issue the warning/summons and get the hell
out of our lives Nazis. Why did they escalate the situation? What for?

The best part of the video is when they say she had the right to remain silent.
LOL! #Copslogic
