Ad Text MAN WHO WAS CHARGED WITH BURNING DA VINCI APARTMENT WAS
ANGRY ABOUT POLICE KILLINGS OF BLACK PEOPLE

The man who was accused of Da Vinci apartment complex arson that caused
the City $100 million in damages testified that he was angry at high-profile
killing of black men.

Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted
about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police
officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses, he was so mad about
the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.

Abdulwalia‘s anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some
apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should
not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was
trying to send: having a black president Changes almost nothing.
