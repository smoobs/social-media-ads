Ad Text Obama once again betrays America.

Reports indicate that he has just put forth a $1.3 billion budget proposal, to be
distributed among 75,000 minors that are expected to cross into the United
States this year from Central America.

That breaks down to about $17,613 a ChiId—an amount that is significantly
higher than what the government gives to Social Security Retirees. According
to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the average annual SSA
retirement benefit for legal Citizens is roughly $14,772.

As if that weren’t enough, the proposal also demands another $2.1 billion for
refugees.

This just says it all. Again and again he ignores the needs of American
Citizens, but has no problem taking their hard earned moneyjust give it to
people who deserve it the least. I guess Veterans don‘t need a better social

security.

Thank you Obama for betraying America.
