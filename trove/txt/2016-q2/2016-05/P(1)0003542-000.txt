Ad Text Guess who can be dirty and racists at the same time? That's right - bad cops!
Instead of protect and serve Citizens, they attack disable people. Thanks to
cell phone cameras, we have a Chance to show to the world a real face of the
US police.

A video Clip uploaded to Facebook shows an officer attempting to throw a
man from his wheelchair and into the street until someone rushes over to
intervene. Also I'd love to know the point of cops rights defenders: what would
you say about another "good cop," who's turning his head as if he didn't see
his partner attempt to hurt the man in wheelchair? Good cops keep silence,
huh?

Such incidents can't happen again, we need to get cops that can't handle their
tempers off of the streets. Guys, what do you think about it? How disgusting
this officer’s actions were?
