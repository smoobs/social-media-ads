Ad Text For the first time in American history, the leading candidate for the Democrat
party is running on a platform that would prohibit the private ownership [or
outright confiscation] of firearms. As a candidate, Hillary has already stated
that the 2nd Amendment does not apply to us.
It is an assault on our Constitution, the very basics of America. Why does she
call herself a Democrat, her anti-American ambitions are more likely to look
like socialism and tyranny, not even close to Democracy.
We are terrified by a possibility of having Hillary as a President. She'll never
stop on the Second Amendment. And if she wins, if she manages to disarm
Americans — get ready to say "good bye" to the First and the Fourth
Amendments either.
