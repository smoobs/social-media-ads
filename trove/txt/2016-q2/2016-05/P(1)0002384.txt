Ad Text It might sound like a cliche but "get a job" is a really good advice for young
liberals protesting against everything in the world. Old man Ronald knew what

Our college students should have an experience of paying taxes before
standing for illegal immigrants' rights. They should rise their own children
before standing for gay parenthood.
It's no secret most active liberal's supporters are people about 20-25 yearsold while most conservatives are older. Well; as they say; wisdom comes with
ages.
