Ad Text We are under attack. Even there is no open action the war has already
started. The enemy is smart and ruthless. We are losing so far, because our
leader is one of them. Obama has betrayed America and now he is just
executing orders of his bosses.
Obama was always a mere pawn in the hands of Arabian Sheikhs. His latest
orders are just proving it. All these refugees, which we are about to take in,
are soldiers with one simple goal. They are going to try to terrorize the nation
until it agrees to convert.
To win this war we need to gather our forces and elect a leader, who loves
America as much as we do and is willing to do everything it takes to protect it.
I believe that only Trump is strong enough to overpower this snake of an
enemy and choke it to death.
We are at war gentlemen! We need to act fast!
