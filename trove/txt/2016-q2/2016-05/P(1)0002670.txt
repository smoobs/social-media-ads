Ad Text Hillary Clinton has a 69 percent disapproval rate among all veterans. Indeed,
there are many reasons for it. First of all, Benghazi: four people died on her
watch and she did not send help. Secondly, Hillary refused to apologize to all
veterans, when she has made several remarks about veterans "embellishing"
the situation at the VA. Finally, Hillary is the only one politician (except Barack
Obama) who is despised by the overwhelming majority of American veterans.
If Hillary becomes the President of the US, the American army should be
withdrawn from Hillary's control according to the amendments to the
Constitution.
