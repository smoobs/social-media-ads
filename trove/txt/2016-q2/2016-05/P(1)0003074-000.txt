Ad Text BLACK STATE TROOPER WHO WON LAWSUIT AGAINST POLICE
DEPARTMENT FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION FACED THE SAME
ISSUED WHEN HE RETURNED TO WORK

Two Michigan Black police troopers who recently won lawsuit in racial
discrimination and were awarded $5.2 million are suing police department
again, Claiming they faced the same issues.

According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever
since they returned to work, they have been subjected to petty attacks and
denied attempts in promotion.

Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police
department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper
Ha|| received a “need improvement rating,” his squad car was taken away,
and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall, police
trooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended
on the basis of race.

Once again the race car is alive and well. Unfortunately, black police officers
still remain second-class officers and experience unfair treatment in police
department despite the fact that we live in a “post-racial” society.
