Kansas City Policeman died this Monday afternoon after being shot by a
suspect. Detective Lancaster was a LLB Air Force veteran and had served
with the. Kanaas £2inI Police Department for ‘10 years.

thur 10 ﬂUl' hero, may.r his soul Rest in Peace. I1 is cur duty t0 remember
the heroes who left this world pratecting us. We must resist th: liberal
propaganda accusing our cups in all deadly sins and we must keep on
repeating: our policemen are real heroes.

II is important 10 rely.r on our police especially on the back UT recent rising
wave of liberal violent protests — our cops become the only guardians to
protem us against rage and violence of hateful crowﬂs.
