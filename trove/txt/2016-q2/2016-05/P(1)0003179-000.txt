Ad Text Parasite is an organism that lives in or on another organism and benefits by
deriving nutrients at the host's expense.

About 20 million parasites live in the United States illegally. They exploit
Americans and give nothing in return. Isn't it time to get rid of parasites that

are destroying our country?
