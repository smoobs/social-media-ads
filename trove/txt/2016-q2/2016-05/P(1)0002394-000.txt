Ad Text If a Republican doesn’t like guns he doesn’t buy one. If a Democrat doesn’t
like guns he wants all guns outlawed. We all know the Supreme Court is now
under a threat of receiving anti-gun majority ofjudges. Only a conservative
President can stop this madness.

Don’t let the Democraps take away your Constitutional right! Vote
Republican, vote Trump, and support the Second Amendment!
