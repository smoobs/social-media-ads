Ad Text Frank Levingston, the oldest veteran in the United States, passed away

Tuesday, May 3 at the age of 110 at a nursing home for veterans in Bossier
Parish, La., according to family members.

Levingston was also the oldest man in the United States. He held the title for
less than a month following the death of Felix Simoneaux Jr. on April 19.

Wish our veterans received more attention and care from our Government.

Obama’s eight presidency years turned into a disaster to our veterans and
soldiers. Hope Obama will be replaced by a President who cares.

We want our old heroes to be proud of their Children and grandchildren so

they would leave this world with a smile, knowing they will be honored and
remembered.
