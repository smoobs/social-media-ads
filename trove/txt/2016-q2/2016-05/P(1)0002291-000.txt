Ad Text Kansas City Policeman died this Monday afternoon after being shot by a
suspect. Detective Lancaster was a US Air Force veteran and had served
with the Kansas City Police Department for 10 years.

Honor to our hero, may his soul Rest in Peace. It is our duty to remember the
heroes who left this world protecting us. We must resist the liberal
propaganda accusing our cops in all deadly sins and we must keep on
repeating: our policemen are real heroes.

It is important to rely on our police especially on the back of recent rising
wave of liberal violent protests — our cops become the only guardians to
protect us against rage and violence of hateful crowds.
