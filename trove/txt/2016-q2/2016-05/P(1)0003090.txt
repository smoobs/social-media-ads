Ad Text FAMILY MEMBERS OF NINE VICTIMS KILLED IN THE MASS SHOOTING
INSIDE A SC CHURCH AREN'T PLEASED WITH DONATIONA PAYOUT
The family members of South Carolina church massacre victims are upset
with the distribution of donations the church has received since June
shooting. The Methodist Episcopal Church have decided that the families will
have to divide $1.5 million in donations, while they will keep $1.8 million; with
plans to make long-needed repairs to the church.
For instance, the wife of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those
killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation
proceeds.
Nothing will bring the victims of Charleston massacre back, but this money
will help aid in bridging the gap in the loss of an income. Donations are
important for these families since they did not receive a cent from the
government.
