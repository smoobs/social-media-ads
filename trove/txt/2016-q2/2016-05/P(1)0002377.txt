Ad Text Yesterday our country lost another hero. Investigator Freeman was killed
when his patrol vehicle was rammed by a suspect vehicle during a pursuit.
Deepest condolences to Anthony's family. Our brave policemen put their
lives at risk every day to make our lives secure.
Our men in police uniform are real heroes and they can't be called any way
but heroes. We don't believe in liberal media accusing our policemen of
being absolutely corrupt and using their authority only for personal benefit.
American policemen are the only guardians who keep our people safe from
criminals.
