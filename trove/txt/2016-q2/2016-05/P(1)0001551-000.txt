Ad Text A new report showed that West Virginia and 11 other states have to the
highest percentage of Children with a parent who is or was incarcerated. Can
you believe these numbers?

Of course, the highest incarceration level is among the black population of the
country. The system is enslaving us with the help of the jails and it affects the
whole community. Kids have to grow up not knowing their fathers and not
having the support they need to make rights Choices and schooI-to-prison
pipeline doesn’t leave them much of a Choice. The kids grow up in extreme
poverty without the access to the basic things like healthcare or education.

The system is build to keep as many black people in the jails as possible.
Being black in the US means being in a constant danger! You never know
when you will be killed or sent to prison, because of the color of your skin.

I’ve never heard white media talking about it, do you?
