Ad Text A new disturbing dashcam video from May 2013 is shining light on what
happened the night a Chicago.

The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez,
brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home, when Morsi-
Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and
demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license,
Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor
Brown, who was beat and pepper—sprayed by police. Brown is not the only
victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.

The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why
the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held
personally and financially responsible for their actions.

Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards Civilians in a combat
zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another
attitude to people in blue?
