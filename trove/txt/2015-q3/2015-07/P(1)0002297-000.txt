Ad Text This man pedaled from Mission beach, San Diego all the way to the east
coast carrying this great flag! He rode in memory of all the fallen troops and
got it signed by service members along the way. It is very common among
service members to sign flags for each other. This man is a true patriot, and
we should be proud of that there are such people in America!
