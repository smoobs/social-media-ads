Ad Text Why do people hate each other?
That's an enormous question, and it's one that eludes an answer.
Why there's so rarely we see acceptance, understanding, tolerance towards
people who are different from "normal" in any way?
I hope that someday all the hatred, all the xenophobia and prejudice between
us will ceased to exist.
And I'm so grateful for my fabulous loving friends who I have shared so much
brilliant times!

more comfortable seeing two men
