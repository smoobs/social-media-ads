Ad Text Police Charges Black Student For Driving To A WeII-Iit Area

Last time I checked US wasn’t involved in any wars or anti-terrorist
operations, at least officially. Well, then how come Detroit is no less
dangerous then (the City ranks third in the list of top 100 US most dangerous
Cities)??

When 24-year-old DaJuawn Wallace saw flashing blue police lights in his
rearview mirror he Chose to proceed with caution since some people are
known to be robbed by fake police officers. He preferred to find a we||-|it area
to pull over in. As a result, he was Charged with ‘fleeing’ police.

People are terrified by the police to such a degree that they even prefer to
communicate with officers only in the we||-|it areas. And get Charged for that.
Sometimes it makes me actually think that when not involved in any military
operations in the foreign countries, our country’s at war with its own Citizens
with the help of police.
