Ad Text Chicago Boy Amari Brown Among 3 Dead, 27 Injured In Just 8—Hour Span

In just an eight-hour span during the Fourth of July weekend, gun violence in
Chicago left three people dead and 27 wounded. Amari Brown, a 7-year-old
boy on the City's West Side, was the youngest of the fatalities.

Those 30 shootings came between 9:20 pm Saturday and 4:45 am. Sunday.
Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and
down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other
relatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire
outside a relative's home where Amari and other Children were playing, hitting
both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the Chest.

No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference
Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in.

How can we feel safe here in America? Permanent threat to life follows every
American like a shadow. What did this boy do to deserve a bullet in his body?
He just played with his friends outdoor. |s human life really worth nothing in
our country?

Rest in peace, Amari Brown.
