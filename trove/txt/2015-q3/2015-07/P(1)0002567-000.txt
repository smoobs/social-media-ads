Ad Text CONGRATS TO ALL THE GAY COUPLESH After a long fight, you have your
much deserved rights!

Same-sex married couples can start applying for Social Security and veterans
benefits in all 50 states even though there are still issues to fix as the federal
government works to implement the Supreme Court ruling allowing gay
couples to marry nationwide.

It is good to be happy! Maybe one day our rights won't be determined based
on what group we belong to. Until then some will be more equal than others.

I think as long as government provides special benefits to married people, all
Citizens should have equal access to those benefits, regardless of whom they
love!
