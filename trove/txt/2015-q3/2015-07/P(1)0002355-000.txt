Ad ID 500

Ad Text Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford told the Congress last week that the
deaths of 500 soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan could be attributed to Iran. This
statement sounds strange on the background of rapproachment between
Obama’s administration and Tehran.

Although, this rapproachment in itself looks strange. We would remind you
that Tehran has never expressed its condolences for the lran hostage crisis.
Moreover, the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Hosseini Khamenei is too
disrespectful to the United States despite of friendly actions of Obama's
administration. And Iranian military command Claims that Iran is ready to
come into collision with America at any moment.

The Iran deal is a shame of the United States. Senate Republicans were right
when they expressed their distrust of Iranian government. It’s not Clear why
Obama has refused containment of Iran that is an potential enemy not only for
the United States, but also for the rest world. Barack Obama is, by all
appearances, a true traitor of the United States. And it’s not empty words —
the rapprochement with Iran is either a treachery or stupidness.
