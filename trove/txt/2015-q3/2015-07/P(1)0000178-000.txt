Ad Text Homophobic nurse tries to discourage birth mom from allowing gay couple to
adopt child

While the birth mother was resting with the baby, Andy and his partner took a
break from the hospital to get some food. When they returned, they had a
flurry of phone messages from the mother, crying and urging them to get back
soon. A nurse had been questioning her about her decision to let a gay
couple adopt her baby.

”Aren’t you afraid those boys are gonna hurt that baby? Aren’t you afraid

that he’s not gonna grow up and be normal?” asked the nurse.

Excuse me who the hell is she?! This bigot is forcing her views onto the
mother, because she doesn't think the baby would grow up "normal"? A
mother who's making the difficult decision to place her son up for adoption,
and a wonderful couple who wants to raise that child. What the hell right does
the nurse have to try to stop that? I hope they fire her.

I'm happy for the Gay couple on becoming parents!
