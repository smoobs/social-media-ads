Ad Text Remember when African Americans couldn't drink from the same drinking
fountains as whites? Remember when gay people couldn't get married? Both
scenarios sound so ridiculous.

Especially when you think about how much money is to be gained if same-sex
couples are legally allowed to get married.

A majority of small business owners believe companies shouldn’t be allowed
to withhold goods or services from lesbian, gay,bisexual or transgender
people based on an owner’s religious beliefs, according to a survey released
Monday.

Of course marriage is good for the business - no matter who it is that is
marrying. It's a billion dollar industry in our country!

I am certain that if a state supported marriage for all, then business would
flourish. No one would be offended by not being considered legitimate, when
their feelings are legitimate.
