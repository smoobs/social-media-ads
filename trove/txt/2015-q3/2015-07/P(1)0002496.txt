Controversial artist Ed Freeman sparked fury among conservative patriots
after sharing his own version of the 1945 image.
The outrage was caused by artist's artwork recreating iconic Iwo Jima photo.
with a gay pride flag and half-naked men has received death threats. That's a
bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don't you think? What's this; the

Around 70.000 U.S. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese. It wasn't a

disrespectful in this image. Isn't the imitation is the best form of homage?
