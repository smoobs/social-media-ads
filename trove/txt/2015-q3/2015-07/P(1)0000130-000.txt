A US. Health and Human Services study to understand why lesbians are fat
has now cost taxpayers over $3.5 million to-date.

The study, “Sexual Orientation and Obesity: A Test of a Gendered
Biopsychosocial Model,” seeks to determine why there is a disparity in the
obesity rates between straight women and lesbian women and straight men
and gay men.

Oh Godll It made you look the fools! People overeat when they are unhappy
with themselves and their lives! Not only lesbians! And we have enough
reasons! First of all — your researchlllt's humiliating!
