Ad Text CAITLYN JENNER: “TRANS PEOPLE DESERVE YOUR RESPECT”
Caitlyn accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2015 ESPY Awards.

Caitlyn is amazing! It was her first public appearance since announcing her
decision to transition.

And her speech brought me to tears. It was very touching and thought
provoking.

She spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender
woman. But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a
thoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the
larger transgender community.

In her past life Caitlyn was known worldwide as a sports hero. Today she is
an American hero of a great courage. Because it takes courage to stand up
and do everything she has done and is doing.
