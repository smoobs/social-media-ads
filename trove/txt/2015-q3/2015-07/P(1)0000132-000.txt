Ad Text Congratulations! Now we have the Gay Scouts of America!

The Boy Scouts of America Executive Committee unanimously approved
allowing gay adults to serve as leaders, officials said on Monday, in a major
step toward dismantling a policy that has caused deep rifts in the 105-year-old
organization.

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders
without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting’s longstanding
policy of Chartered organizations selecting their leaders.

The Boy Scouts of America’s ban on gay adults has stood as a towering
example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America’s most
important and recognizable Civic organizations.

This is a step in the right direction, but we’re still really concerned that there
are still going to be groups that are going to be hostile to gay |eaders...This
story certainly brought out the haters and the loony "Christians." They've lost
so many cultural battles in their effort to keep us all in the middle ages that I
think it's unhinged most of them!
