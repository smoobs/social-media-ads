fundamentally, about who you want to have sex with — but who you are, and
who you love...
One of the execs on children's cartoon series Steven Universe has confirmed
a lesbian romance between two characters.
The popular show is based on a young boy named Steven, who grows up
with three magical aliens — the 'Crystal Gems' Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl.
The show, which has already won praise for including a number of strong,
female characters in a comparatively male-dominated genre, has now hinted
at further diversity.
That's s000 nice! More and more shows go that route, even if it's probably just
for advertising it's still good.
