Ad Text On the national level, the suicide risk for gay, lesbian and transgender youth
is far higher than it is among straight youth.

LGBTQ youth actively plan suicide at a 2.6 times greater rate than straight

youth.
LGBTQ youth attempt suicide at a 4.0 times greater rate than straight youth.
LGBTQ youth require medical attention for suicide attempts at a 5.1 times

greater rate than straight youth.
Behind these numbers are countless lives lost.

This has to stop!

Discuss problems together — but only at the initiative of the youth. Be caring
and supportive discussing these issues. Don't sweep the problems "under the

carpet"!
