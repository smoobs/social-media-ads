Ad Text The Journey Begins: Caitlyn Jenner launches weekly blog on LGBT issues

The most fabulous trans icon Caitlyn Jenner is a blogger now. She posted the
first letter in what is to be a series of personal posts for WhoSay Monday,
titled, "The Journey Begins."

The blog will be dedicated to become a voice for the LGBT community.

"Up until now, l have totally isolated myself from the transgender community
so I have a lot of catching up to do," Jenner says. "I feel such a responsibility
to this courageous group to try to get it right and tell all sides of the story. To
me, that's always the biggest question: am I doing it right?"

Finally our community got someone who will represent our position and
actually help people struggling with being transgendered, like helping them
with surgery, medications and etc.

Caitlyn is a real new American hero!
