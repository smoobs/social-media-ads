Ad Text Nature Chooses who will be transgender; individuals don't Choose this

We received a letter... the history of life...

«Hello! Just wanted to see if you could share my coming out as trans story on
your page. I have been on a long, rough journey to this point and I think my
story could help younger trans youth see that no matter how bad it gets it
always gets better. I would really appreciate this because I want to become
someone who inspires the LGBT community to be themselves!

Ever since I was little, I knew I was different. I wasn’t like any of the other
kids. I had a unique way of thinking and often that left me isolated. Something
I still feel the sting of today. Unlike most boys who played with Spiderman and
Superman action figures when they were little, I played with barbies... I
wanted to look like them. I wanted to be them. It felt right playing with these
dolls. I had to hide when I did it though because even at an early age, I knew
boys weren’t supposed to play with dolls. Once I had gotten got caught by

my grandmother’s ex husband and he told me to put them away and stop
being a sissy..."

Please spend 5 minutes to read this letter... it is very important just to be
head”.

Thank you for your brave act! You are a true hero!

Please share your stories and photos... Inspire us and others!
