Ad Text SOLDIER SHANE.
Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
Let's meet the big player in repealing the ban.
Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
among his fellow Army soldiers.
But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first
openly trans soldier of the US Army.
He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska.
Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.
But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!
America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war.
