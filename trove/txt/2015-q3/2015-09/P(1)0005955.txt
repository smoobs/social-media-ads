Today many liberals encroach upon the right of Americans to bear arms.
They argue there are many unreliable people in the United States. They
think this argument gives them the right to spit upon commandments of our
Founding Fathers. But if the problem is mentally ill thugs, maybe we should
toughen up firearms licensing rules for people from most dangerous
districts? It doesn't mean we propose to ban guns there. But these people
should be carefully checked regarding the systematic use of drugs and
mental disorders. And I would not be surprised if most of people who failed
drug tests were liberals.
Maybe it sounds rude a bit. But we found a similar idea among petitions for
Obama's administration on the White House website.
Do you support this petition?
