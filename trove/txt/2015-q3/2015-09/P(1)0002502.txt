Ad Text Gay the force be with you: Star Wars soldier comes out
Hero soldier Sinjir Rath Velus comes out in a new novel, which is part of the
smash hit sci-fi franchise with arch-baddie Darth Vader.
The space warrior appears in Star Wars: Aftermath, which bridges the gap
between Return of the Jedi and new film The Force Awakens.
Sinjir, an Imperial turncoat who now serves in Luke Skywalker's Rebellion, is
the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his
sexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to chat him up.
Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: "I don't think his
sexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it's part of who
he is.
Isn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the
creators of the new "Star Wars" for the incredible courage and opposition to
conservative bias in Hollywood cinema. There should be a special
organization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors. There
should be at least one gay character in every movie in order to help the
American society get rid of homophobic stereotypes.
