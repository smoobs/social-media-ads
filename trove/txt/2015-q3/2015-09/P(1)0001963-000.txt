Ad Text We won‘t apologize for our blackness. It‘s not our duty to do that. Black is
beautiful. Beautiful is forever and it makes us to be proud. We will carry it with
us everywhere and forever. We don‘t care if the government doesn‘t want to
accept the fact that we are stronger than we were before. We don‘t care if the
government doesn‘t see our problems. We can build our history on our own,
because we are stronger by nature.
