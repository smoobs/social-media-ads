Ad Text Innocent Bystanders Could Face Criminal Charges for Not Jumping in to Help
Officer Make Arrest

Residents of Huntsville, Alabama who declined to intervene to help a police
officer subdue a suspect could face criminal prosecution under a state statute
requiring them to assist an officer in trouble. Had the situation been reversed,
however, police officers would face neither criminal nor Civil prosecution for
declining to aid a Citizen under assault by a suspect.

A man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident,
allegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers
responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed
Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to
intervene.

Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid “was
reasonable under the Circumstances,” but the burden of demonstrating that
this is the case is placed upon the accused.

When you'll see a bunch of cops beating an unarmed man, don't forget that
you can be in his place just for not helping cops in committing a crime.
