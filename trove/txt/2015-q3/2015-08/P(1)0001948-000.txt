Ad Text Silenced racism in America

Tamir Rice, Rumain Brisbon, Kajieme Powel, Dante Parker, Michael Brown,
John Crawford III, Eric Garner, Jonathan Ferrell, Kimani Gray, Michael Brown
and Sandra Bland are one of many examples of excessive police brutality
used on black Americans.

You never know if a simple traffic stop will end up with you in a police custody
or bullets in your Chest.

Unfortunately, many of Americans feel very uncomfortable talking about these
issues, which seem to confirm the idea that the government remain silent.
Nevertheless, one should accept that African-Americans are more likely to be
targeted by police officers on the street than whites. Therefore it endangers
the rights of black community.

Doubtless when the government defends the officers who have killed black
men, it strikes us how unfair the system is and reaffirms our view that America
would spend billions of dollars on radical extremists than talking about the
domestic terrorism, racial inequality and police brutality.
