Ad Text Discrimination runs rampant in too many people in this country - and it comes
in too many forms. Ok! I just noticed one interesting thing ... The kids that need
foster care come from heterosexual families. So I think the straights should be
banned from being foster parents!
A Kansas Department of Children and Families official said that the state will
continue to allow qualified single adults to serve as foster parents for abused
and neglected children, but she said her agency isn't ready to say whether it
will allow married same-sex couples to do so.
Oh God ... Just because your gay doesn't make you any less of a human or
any less deserving of any right afforded to anyone else! Anyone who believes
that a gay person is below a straight person needs treatment!
It is time for this freaking discrimination to end! They have no valid reasons for
denying married gays from adopting and fostering kids. All they are doing is
denying kids loving homes because of their own bigotry.
