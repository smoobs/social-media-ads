Ad Text BREAKING NEWS! St. Louis police fatally shot a black teenager while trying
to issue search warrant

On Wednesday, Aug. 19 racial tensions again sparked in Missouri City after
St. Louis police officers fatally shot black teenager at Walton Avenue and
Page Boulevard while trying to issue search warrant. According to St. Louis
Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and
was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search
warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the
suspect four times were about seven years on the force.

That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later
on, nine people were arrested on Charges of resisting arrest. The protesters
said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if
this situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why
do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that
the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters
who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the City and the
government needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in
America instead of suspecting every single black men?

We cannot accept the fact that police can easily kill black people in America,
than we must do something about it. Protest or accept it. You Choose. This is
your life.
