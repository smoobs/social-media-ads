Ad Text ABOUT 15,500 TRANS PEOPLE ACTIVELY SERVE IN THE MILITARY.
It's estimated that over 134000 American veterans are transgender.
Not long ago these people were forced into hiding. As a result, many were
unable treatments for their gender dysphoria, a state of emotional distress
caused by how the gender someone was designated at birth conflicts with
their gender identity.
Coming out as transgender requires telling everyone in your life about you
and enduring the consequences which often means the loss of family, lifelong
friends, your job, and being the subject of ridicule, discrimination, and often
violence. No one makes the decision easily and no one transitions unless
they have to do so.
Transphobic slur of stupid politicians like GOP presidential hopeful Mike
Huckabee seeking to tremendous efforts of transgender community who are
still struggle for equal rights.
We know how easily bigots and fools who has power are able to reverse
progressive changes for their own benefit. We can't let that happen!
These people know what it means to be Transgender and know what it is to
serve in our Armed Forces. We respect their opinion in both of these areas,
especially over those of Governor Huckabee who has not experienced or
accomplished either.
