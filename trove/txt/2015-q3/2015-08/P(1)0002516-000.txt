Ad Text An openly gay Cuban American poet will take part in Friday’s ceremony at
the US. Embassy in Cuba where the American flag will be raised. The
ceremony will mark the official reopening of the US. embassy along
Havana’s oceanfront promenade that overlooks the Florida Straits.

‘My inspiration is thinking about 90 miles separating the two countries and
the two people, 90 miles is the sea between us.’ Just 90 miles, but at the
same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba.

The poet added he hopes there’s still possible to achieve “healing” between
the two countries.

‘This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities...This just seems so
surreal sti||...This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new
things to come.’

It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba,
country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country
abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of
these conflicts... And there’s more - severe economic crisis, socialist
dictatorship of Cuban leaders.

It’s time for us to lend a helping hand.
