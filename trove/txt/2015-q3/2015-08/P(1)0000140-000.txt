Ad Text We are not here to entertain straight people. They can stare all they want. But
please stop asking these stupid questions about "lesbian relationships"!!

We don’t think of ourselves as a “lesbian couple”, so pleas stop saying that.
We think of ourselves as a “couple”, and like any other, we are a couple who
is madly in love and who doesn’t want to hide that love in order to make other
people feel more comfortable.

Oh you'd like to join because you've seen a lot of adult videos with "lesbians"?
You think our deeply emotional, fully satisfying-on-all-levels relationship is just
an act, a make-out for you to watch? For you to join us in our bedroom?

No, no and NO.
