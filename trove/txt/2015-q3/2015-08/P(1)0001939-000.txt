Ad Text Why black parents worry about their Children? How should we talk to our

Children about how safely interact with police officers in order to protect
themselves?

Tina Carter—Shileds has five kids and three of them recently started to drive.
The first thought she had when they wanted to drive alone was 'Wait a
minute. I'm really scared right now.' What should they do if they get pulled
over? What if they do something they don‘t supposed to be doing? It is not
always fair when officers arrest African Americans, but it‘s a reality. What if

police officers will automatically assume that your Child is criminal because of
how him or her looks.

Black parents should remember that their kids will always be judged by the
way they look. That‘s why it‘s important to instruct our Children how to react
when you are in trouble with law enforcement. Because if a stranger follows
your Child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles, ran back into the store.
Remember, anything is better than dying.

Anyways, it‘s hard to believe that in 21st century black parents have to teach

their Children both survive and thrive. But who will take responsibility for
training police officers?
