Ad Text The drama in Pocomoke. A Maryland town several weeks ago fired its first
black Police Chief, now exposing a racial rift

The leaders of small Maryland‘s City in Eastern Shore fired the Pocomoke
City‘s first black police Chief Kelvin Sewell due to his incompetence and
refusal to fire black police officers Franklin Savage and Lynell Green. Chief
Sewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the
Baltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell‘s dismissal he filed a
complaint on unequal employment opportunities Claiming he was paid less
than his white predecessors.

This is Circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts
based on race and income. Racism has gotten so bad, black people are
treated unfairly. If God created us equally, why the unequal treatment of
minorities still exists in our country? What if the firing gas stirred a new spirit
of African-American activism?
