Ad Text Ladies & Gents, today we remember one of the realest ever Lone Rangers,
Bass Reeves. Mostly described as the “lawman second to none,” a man who
was “absolutely fearless and also labelled, the Black Hero Marshal.

Reeves was born to slave parents in 1838 in Crawford County Arkansas, but
Bass Reeves would become the first black U.S. Deputy Marshal west of the
Mississippi River and one of the greatest frontier heroes in the history of this

country.
