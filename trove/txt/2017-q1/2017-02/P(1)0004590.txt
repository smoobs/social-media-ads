A Like Rave

Elijah McCoy was born in Colchester, Ontario, Canada on May 2, 1844.

ELUAH McCoy (1 843-1 929)
INVENTED AN OIL-DRIPPING CUP FOR T KAY N'~

OTHER INVENTORS TRIED TO COPY MCCOYS OIL-DRIPPINC CUP.
BUT NONE OF THE OTHER CUPS WORKED AS WELL AS HIS,
SO CUSTOMERS STARTED ASKING FOR `THE REAL MCCOY.'
THAT'S WHERE THE EXPRESSION COMES FROM.
