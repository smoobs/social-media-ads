Ad Text How can we be illegal on our own land? The United States unfairly took from
Mexico what is now the Southwest of the country in the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo that ended the Mexican-U.S. War. The ceded territory included what
is now Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, and parts of Colorado,
Nevada and Utah. This greater area represents the point of parting of the
Aztec migrations.
