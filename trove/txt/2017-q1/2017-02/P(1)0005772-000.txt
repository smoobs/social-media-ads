Ad Text Lemme take a minute of your time and remind you how much we are magical
on planet earth.

This little King right here, now probably 11-years (8-y-o in the pic.) recently
finished a Science Course at Imperial College London University was and still
reigns as the smartest kid on planet earth, studied at the Oxford University at
the age of 6.

And yes, he was too advanced for his required school grade so that lead him
into being homeschooled. He excels in Math, Foreign Languages, History,
Philosophy, IT and Science.

Now tell me Black people are not magic!
