Ad Text I have always admired the strength of Black women to strive for success and
here i serve us all again with this delighting success of Barbara Ross-Lee, a
physician and the first African-American woman to become the dean of a
predominantly white medical school.

Thank you for your inspiration, paving the way for young Black girls to dream
bigger and achieve greater heights.
