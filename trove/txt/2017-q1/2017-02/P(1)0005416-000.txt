Harvard University is one of the best schools in the whole world and when a
Black woman is becoming a president of Harvard Law Paper it’s huge!
Education for the Black people was never easy, starting slave period when
Black people could be killed for reading a book, including today when
thousands of kids cannot get the education because of their skin color and the
prejudice of the teachers, and this girl is proving that times are Changing.
Recently Black women were called the most educated group of people in the
US and years by, we can see that those women are starting to make
Changes. Here and there we hear the news about Black people holding the
positions for the first time in history and trust me, it’sjust a beginning!
We are so happy to see the whole nation waking up and realizing the
importance of both hustle and education.
