After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's
hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.
The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.
Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.
The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a halfinch wide.
Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have
different hair texture.
