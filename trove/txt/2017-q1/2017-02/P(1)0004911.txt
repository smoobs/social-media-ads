Ad Text Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran
members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee(SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said "We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support."
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for "communications within the diaspora," and the
spear symbolizes "whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people."
The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice.
This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a "free
spaces"for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear
today, in 2017.
