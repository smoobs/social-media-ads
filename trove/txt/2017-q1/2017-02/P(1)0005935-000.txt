spent a lot of my Childhood in different systems and I had no idea about the
beast that communities of color are fighting. My mother didn't know about the
schooI-to-prison pipeline, she just knew she had a black boy.” Coleman
explained how his work with wrongfully-convicted Clients had shaped his view
of the US. criminal justice system, which he described as racially lopsided.
“It’s not by choice that most of my Clients are African American," Coleman
said. "It’s a fact of life and of the prison system. If most of the people going
into the system are black men, most of my clients will be too.” The Duke
Journal of Gender Law and Policy hosted a symposium Tuesday focusing on
efforts to improve criminal justice and the American prison system. Titled
“Intersectionality and the Black Lives Matter Movement,” the event featured a
panel of speakers, including James Coleman, John S. Bradway professor of
the practice of law, and Umar Muhammad, community organizer for the
Southern Coalition for Justice, along with Theresa Newman, Clinical professor
of law. “I didn’t feel prepared for the world. I didn’t feel rehabilitated. I had no
resources,” Muhammad said. ~The Chronicle~
