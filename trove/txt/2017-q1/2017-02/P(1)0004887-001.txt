"There‘s no way I would have anything without her. She's my inspiration,"
Serena eaid about her sister. Now Serena has 23 major singles titles. She's
abeut to make a new werld record but ehe'e already made history.

Serena is still the heel tennis player at her 35. Serena and Venus made
tennis black. Never before the world had a chance te admire black:
excelxlence en the tennis court.

Despite the stupid meckeriee aimed at their race and appearance, the
Williams sisters are still the best, full of love and perfection! Thank you
sisters! You made all at us great!
