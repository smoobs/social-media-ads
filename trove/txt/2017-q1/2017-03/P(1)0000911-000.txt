Ad Text Ah immigration judge has ordered an Army veteran from Chicago, who served
two tours of duty, to be deported. His name is Miguel Perez and he is Chicano
in every sense of the word. Perez moved to Chicago when he was 8—years-
old and was a permanent legal resident. He joined the US. Army and served
two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an
explosion. Perez served seven years, but because he is not a US. citizen,
Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and

began the deportation process.
This system doesn't appreciate our sacrifices. America was designed that

way it will only benefit gringos. Miguel Perez is a real hero, who was betrayed
by America. When will we have real justice in this country?
