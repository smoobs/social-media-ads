Irma Gnnzalsz was ans at six women inducted into the San Disgn Gaunt}!
Women's Hall of Fame earlier this month. This is a hugs step for s Istins
woman in the US. She says: "Diversity on the bench is so impm'tsnt because
the psspls that sums ts court some from all different wslI-ts of tits, different
ethnic backgrounds, different religisus backgrounds."

However, it it's s sign at diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are
indigenous inhabitants at this land and we wsrs cut off all privileges since
gsbsshos cams and stole our land. 30. it took almsst EDD years for our
woman to reach a prestigious positisn in ths government that is not really
caring about us! Whether there are latinns 0r nut, authorities will osntinus to
deport us imm our indigensus land!
