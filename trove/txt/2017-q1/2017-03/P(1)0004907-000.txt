Ad Text It's hard to express how simple and deep this phrase is! SeIf-empowermeht
and seIf-identification is our way! We built America but white people invented
their rules. Their system is not for us. Sometimes we can succeed in their
game but it's better to concentrate on our own issues. When white people do
something for us they see us as strangers anyway, we will always be "others"
for them.

Thankfully there were a lot of African Americans who devoted their lives to
community. Let's join them! Let's build America again! We talk not only about
houses and infrastructure.
