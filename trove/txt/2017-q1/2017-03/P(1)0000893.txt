WE DON'T STEAL JOBS

"thout my parents
"I immigrated to th
old. I went to high school
when I was 16
from 8am to 2:05pm and worked from 4pm to
midnight.I did homework after work,and it
used to take me a long time because I didn't
speak English.I graduated from high school
with a 3.8 GPA and went on to college and
became a high school teacher."
