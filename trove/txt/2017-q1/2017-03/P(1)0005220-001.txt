Though the ancient Maya people wrote
thousands of books, only 4 of them
survived. The Maya had an advanced

riting system that recorded their history

for more than 800 years back, but all
of their texts were burned during the
Spanish conquest by priests who

thought them to he "lies of the devil.”
