Christ Nelson, 19, was born without hands, but it didn‘t stop him from

expressing himself through his artworks. Despite his struggles, Nelson
recently graduated from Lincoln West High School in Cleveland, Ohio and
received a prestigious honor voted by principals and teachers. Moreover,
apart from drawing and sketching, Nelson composes music and hopes to

drive someday.
