Ad Text ATTENTION! COMMUNITY CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT!

Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!

This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim, “Check my bag. I’m telling you I don’t have anything.” And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?

Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black
people were treated disrespectfully! We don’t believe apologies, especially
when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!
