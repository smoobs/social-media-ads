It‘s hard to express how simple and deep this phrase is! Salt-ampowennaant
and setf-idantntfication is Dltlt' way! We built .Mertca but white peqpta invented
their rules. their system is not tar us. Sometimes we can sumead in their
game but it‘s batter tn concentrate an our awn issues. When white peoplta dn
something for us they see us as strangers anway, we W'lilﬂl aways be
"others" for them.

Thamﬂvtfullyr there were a lot at African Americans wlm demtad theirr lives to
mmmmnity. Llat'E join tiham'! Let's build America again! We tallk nut Dmty about
Ehauses and infrastmmturna.
