Ad Text New trends. Often "new trends" of American and European cultures is
nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to
education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to
confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from
another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks
and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird.
White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We
have beautiful culture and history!
