Ad Text Alek Wek is now a hero for many of us. Supermodel decided not to go with
the crowd that set the European standards of beauty. Despite the fact that all
of the fashion models were obliged to wear blond wigs, she did something
that was against the norm- she took her wig off and threw it in the crowd.
