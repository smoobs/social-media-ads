One question that ahuays got me wnrried is, do we in one way or the nther
stand a chance of protesting uur people with Elam pimple in charga of
things?

Whatever the system has got cm Elam panple, i hnpa these 8 black wnman,
who were elemad as judges in Jefferson County. Alabama, are able and will
be wiiling to cause a change ii” the lives of Black paﬂpie. For now, we say,
well done ladies!
