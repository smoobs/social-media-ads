Native American teens made an interesting journey threugh their ancestral
lands. "the journey was led by Sarah Pemtb-erten member (if the Delaware
Nation. Sarah and her partner |<er Harris created a mmie about the journey
called "The Water Gap: Ftetum to the Homelands" which already wen the
award at the Native American Film Festival! of the Seutheaet.

Prepeg ends at native culture and traditions ie one at most powerful weapons
in Native Ameﬁcan fight for their rights. Peopte have always tried to destroy
things theyr den't understand. And white people never understand native
culture preperly. Many teens who had native ancestors deep in the peel
knew nothing about their culture. Flime. jeurneye, even videos on Youtube,
can help.
