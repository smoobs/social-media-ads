Ad Text Welcome to the future.
I'm very proud of all our Black youth out there making a difference by getting
knowledge. The future is bright and our liberation is certain, just stay woke to

the system and don't get drowned in it's deceit.

"We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth
for the future" - Franklin D. Roosevelt
