Ad Text One question that always got me worried is, do we in one way or the other
stand a chance of protecting our people with Black people in charge of
things?
Whatever the system has got on Black people; i hope these 8 black women.
who were elected as judges in Jefferson County; Alabama, are able and will
be willing to cause a change in the lives of Black people. For now, we say;
well done ladies!
