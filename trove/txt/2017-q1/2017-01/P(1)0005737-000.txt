Ad Text One question that always got me worried is, do we in one way or the other
stand a Chance of protecting our people with Black people in Charge of
things?

Whatever the system has got on Black people, i hope these 8 black women,
who were elected as judges in Jefferson County, Alabama, are able and will
be willing to cause a Change in the lives of Black people. For now, we say,
well done ladies!
