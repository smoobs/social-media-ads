Ad Text Houstonians, come out to honor the memory of Huey P. Newton, and other
black leaders and prominent members of the Black Panther Party on October
15!
We should revive their legacy and discuss the plan that Newton and Seale
crafted to empower Black communities economically. The plan contained
basic demands such as self—determination, decent housing, full employment,
education that included African-American history, and an end to police
brutality. The list of confirmed speakers will be released a few days before the
event
