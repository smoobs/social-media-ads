Ad Text A Fort Worth man broke into the State Capitol in Austin to deface a Civil Warera portrait
Apparently, the man's main goal was to destroy the portrait of former Texas
Governor Fletcher Stockdale. The man was arrested right in the Capitol and
charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief.
It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards
Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale.
Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda
influences even on Southern people.
The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be
blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American
history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect.
It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect
our history and fight against liberal brainwashing.
