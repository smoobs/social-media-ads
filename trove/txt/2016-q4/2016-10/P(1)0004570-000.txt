Ad Text November 22 will mark the second anniversary of the Tamir Rice's death. The
12-year-old was carrying a toy airsoft gun when officer Timothy Loehmann
shot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not
indict the killer.

Tamir’s mother said she is “mad as hell” with the grand jury’s decision of
declaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say, “He was my bright and
shining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to
become anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn’t
give him a Chance”.

Due to the corrupt system, Samaria Rice has a dead Child.

However; he will always live in our hearts. Join us on November 26 to honor
the memory of Tamir and show support to his family. Remember Tamir Rice
