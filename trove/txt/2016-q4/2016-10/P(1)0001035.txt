Ad Text HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS
The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:
—Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.
—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans'
medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20
million for veterans' health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits."
In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!
Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!
