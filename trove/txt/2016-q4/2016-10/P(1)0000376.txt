Ad Text A black man employed by Comcast being given a ticket for doing his job.
This man was working on a house when a bystander reported him to the
cops. When police showed up, they drew the gun and told the man to put his
hands up because he was accused of walking around the property, looking
through windows and searching for a way to steal from home. Despite the fact
that the man wore a red Comcast shirt and was standing next to his white
Comcast truck searching for some wiring to do his job, the police gave him a
ticket for literally doing his job. Welcome to the United States of Racism.
