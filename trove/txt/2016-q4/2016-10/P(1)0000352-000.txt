Ad Text FOOTBALL COACH SUSPENDED AND THE WHOLE SEASON CANCELED
AFTER YOUNG ATHLETES TOOK A KNEE

Young people continue to take a knee during a national anthem to protest
police brutality and racial injustice in America. However, most of these
athletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10,
after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the
Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day,
the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive
board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season
and canceled the whole football season. So now we know what opposition
might face in this country.
