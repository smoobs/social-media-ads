Ad Text I pity anyone who has to deal with neighbors in an apartment building.
Especially when you have to deal with the complaining and passive-
aggressive types. Oh, and let’s not forget gentrifiers. Or, as I like to call them,
“white migrators.” Apparently, instead of knocking on a neighbor’s door,
people take the easy and passive-aggressive way out and just leave notes
instead. But one man wasn’t having it.
