Ad Text October 22 is the National Day of Protest. October 22nd is a day that people
around the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of
Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a
Generation.
Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims
and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most wellknown case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was
shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,
who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.
We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police
representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and
serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!
Join us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between
Charlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. National
Day of Protest. Charlotte, NC
