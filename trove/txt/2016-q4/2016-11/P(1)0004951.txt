A recent study has revealed some surprising differences in credit scores
between African-Americans and Caucasians.
The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between
$65,000 and $75,000 per year.
Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to AfricanAmericans.
Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some
researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.
