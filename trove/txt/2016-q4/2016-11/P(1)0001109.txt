Ad ID 2985
Ad Text On the video you see Brinkley Police Department Chief Edward Randle
driving his car more than 100 miles per hour to the football game.
He is pulled over by cops. They realize that they stopped their chief, so they
just laughed together and let their chief go.
According to THV11 "since the officer did not announce the truck's license
plate number into his radio, nobody else would know the chief had been
pulled over."
Fortunately this guardian of order didn't kill anyone with his speeding car that
day, but he probably will do it next time.
