Ad Text A free-spirited mind thinks deeply. Thins mind thinks about being detached
from the system since Childbirth, thinks about the liberation of his people,
thinks about survival in all possible cases.

Most importantly, a free-spirited mind always survives, doesn't perish and

even does well under any given condition.
I hope y'all striving to be free yourselves from the system.
