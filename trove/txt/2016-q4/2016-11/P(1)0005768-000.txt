Ad Text End the whining and crying, end the riots with these same white
people(democrats), who will not march with you when your son, daughter or
loved one gets shot for being Black.

I opted out of the elections and i had many Black people all up in my case,
telling me how i was wrong and how i needed to make my vote count for Mrs.
Clinton, all just to make sure Trump doesn't become president.

Well now all i want to say is get over Trump and Clinton, they are rich white
people, the elite who were born into and are a part of the system.

I dream of liberation, not staying a slave under Hillary or Trump, so forget
your Childish rioting, no one has shot!
