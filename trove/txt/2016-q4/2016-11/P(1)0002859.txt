DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK
North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-yearold Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in selfdefense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.
Slager's defense attorney's:
"The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a splitsecond life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.'
The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.
We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to
other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay.
