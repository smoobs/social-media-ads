STRUGGLED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER

Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor—UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, “It‘s Up to Us,” she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people‘s lives.

Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be
killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half
of people shot by cops are mentally ill?

Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the
field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals.
