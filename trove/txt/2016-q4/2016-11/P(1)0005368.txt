If you exclusively date outside of your ethnicity and culture, you hate yourself.
Don't talk to me until you start to love yourself.
I'm going to get many people complaining about this post... I don't care. If you
won't check for your own people, seek help not more approval.
I'm not saying you should ever check for people outside of your culture, I am
saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your
culture/ethnic group, you have issues of the mind. You are doing this not by
love but on purpose, because you hate yourself subconsciously, it's ok, just
love yourself and heal your illness. ?
