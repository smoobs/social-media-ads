Ad Text There's a lot of mythology surrounding redheaded people, but one ignorant
assumption trumps them all: Redheads are white.

The reality? They're not.

Photographer @IamMichelleMarshall is raising awareness of this fact through
her photo series "M1CR" the series, named after the gene variant responsible
for red hair and freckles, features individuals of Afro—Caribbean descent who
carry this gene and, therefore, embody certain aesthetic traits associated with
redheads."
