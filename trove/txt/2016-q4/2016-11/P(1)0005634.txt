Ad Text Here you can see guy was harassed for allegedly having a bottle of alcohol in
his University dorm room. Pigs forced their way into the room without his
consent and opened the fridge. When they didn't find alcohol (there was just
ranch dressing) they threatened him with expelling from University.
WTF??
This is what you get when you are going to get education in America.
