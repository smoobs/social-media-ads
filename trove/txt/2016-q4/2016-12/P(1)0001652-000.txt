Ad Text White is not right! Why do you think that Santa is white?
Nobody knows the color of his skin, nobody has ever seen him, but white
supremacists go crazy if they see a black Santa.
That’s always making me laugh.
I would advice white racists to love the snow for its whiteness and to hate the
coil for its blackness.
No matter that the snow is killing you and the coil gives you the heat to
survive.
