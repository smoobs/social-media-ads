Ad Text I pity anyone who has to deal with neighbors in an apartment building.
Especially when you have to deal with the complaining and passiveaggressive types. Oh, and let's not forget gentrifiers. Or, as I like to call them,
"white migrators." Apparently, instead of knocking on a neighbor's door,
people take the easy and passive-aggressive way out and just leave notes
instead. But one man wasn't having it.
