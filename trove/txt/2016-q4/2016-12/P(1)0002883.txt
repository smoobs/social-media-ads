Ad Text COLIN KAEPERNICK DONATED TO BLACK YOUTH PROJECT 100
Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin
Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America
in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.
Kaepernick donated to the Chicago chapter of the organization toward
"Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures" which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.
"I'll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what
are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those
communities," he said.
When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there
is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don't really care
about haters.
Good job, Colin.
