This Monday Clinton had a public interview event where she was asked to
term about Iraq war and intervention in Libya during her being as a secxretarry

‘natinnal scandaﬂ, after Iu’ffirzziallyr being caught an Ilie/s. she aﬁard‘ed hams” to
make a statement “I‘ve said Iraq was a mistake. Libya was a diﬂeram kind of
cajlmwlalinn. And we didn‘t Inge a single person.“

More than mrae years passed after tha accident and atill Glinmn didn‘t even
mntact Banghazi 1urictirr'ns'farm'lilies. She didn't even try to ask for excuse. like
those murdered! Americans don't Ewen exist. We deﬁnitely dnn’t need a
President who lies withuut a twinge of mnmienca. Luckily must Americans
want trust such an obvious liar.
