Brendan Carter decided in pay a 1urisii in his sick uncle and was held by
ofﬁcers in a puibilic HTS bus station in Finchsstvsr. New York. Carter said he
was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from amortiansl trauma.
Carter decided in hip his soul with music, when he put. his hs-adphonss m
and startsd to dance. Suddenlly, nfiicsrs sppmached him and began asldng
him out oi the premises, Appsrentiy he had nut committed any crime or
violated ah}:r order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with, them.
Seriously this guy was dstainsd far useless reasons. This is what American
police find: interest in ‘— unnecessary and useless wayr a1? harassing ham.
Vary ridiculnus.
