Ad Text Brendan Carter decided to pay a visit to his sick uncle and was held by
officers in a public RTS bus station in Rochester, New York. Carter said he
was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma,
Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on
and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking
him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or
violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.
Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American
police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks.
Very ridiculous.
