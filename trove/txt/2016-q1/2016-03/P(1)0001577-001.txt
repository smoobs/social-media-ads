An amnum m‘ $340K was donated tn the family M the deceased James
Anderson. Are theyr fucking kidding us? Eortham it's enough and waal‘th it,
but to the fremr'rliilyr of Anderson it's not better than the life taken. These guys
should pay a death penalty tar taking a life. This is a racial act. Hepnrl says
between hits, thwaghuI screamed, “mite power!" before Badman ran him over,
causing fatal injuries. There is no particular reason fur whatever they did an
America shouldn‘t think they have done something much greater. “Money
cannot buy life,“ that is what Bah Nesta r'uiarlnezqyr said and he is ahsnluteily
right.
