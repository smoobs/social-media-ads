Ad Text HUMAN RIGHTS PHOTO CHALLENGE

Despite our race, religion, gender, age, education, sexual orientation and
beliefs, we are all HUMANS.

In the midst of the presidential race, all what politicians dream about is
money. They keep giving empty promises in order to win votes. And this is
our friendly reminder for the candidates: we are the ones who elect them. We
don’t deserve having problems with employment, marriage, Child birth etc...
We all deserve the right to be accepted.

Go for it! Clicking the “like” button is not enough.
If you want to attract the candidates' attention to the fight for human rights, do

the following:
1) Take a picture with Campaign (HUMAN RIGHTS) logo (state required)

2) Post it in comments within a week
3) Share with your friends

For the first place $50; second place $30; third place $20
