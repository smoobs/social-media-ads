Ad Text You can color your own Bernie Hero!
There is a new coloring book calling "Buff Bernie: A coloring Book for
Berniacs" is full of very attractive doodles of Bernie Sanders in muscle poses.
The author of the book said that she wanted people to stop taking this whole
thing too serious. The coloring is something that suits for all people.
I totally agree with her! I've recently heard some hateful comments from the
Hillary supporters about Bernie Sanders and his supporters, so I really love
the idea of this color book. I think that Bernie would love it!
