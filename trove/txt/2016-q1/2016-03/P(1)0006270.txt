Ad Text Last Saturday night. 68-year-old David Rice, also known as Mondo we Langa,
a former Black Panther passed away Nebraska prison.
In 1970, Rice was one of the two officers who were charged for the murder of
Omaha police officer, Larry Minard. Authorities claim they coaxed Larry to a
house with a 911 call, and then detonated a homemade bomb that killed him.
He was the seventh-longest-serving inmate in Nebraska.
Subsequent paroles and retrials were denied for these two men. Langa was in
prison for 45 years. Details of the cause of his death are still unknown.
Rest in peace, Mondo we Langa.
