Ad Text Click to Learn More! Everybody knows that Islam is against terrorism but not
everyone believes this fact! Islam does not support terrorism under any
circumstances. Terrorism goes against every principle in Islam. In fact if a
Muslim engages in terrorism, he is not following Islam and so he is not a
Muslim! America, stop insulting peaceful citizens, stop taking all of us as
criminals, we don't deserve such attitude! #muslimvoice #muslim @muslim
