Ad Text There're a lot of racial discrimination going on in America these days. Can

you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have

vowed to kill if they are forced to leave there unless the government Change
the law in their favor. Nonsense!

The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it’s never been more
apparent that the US. government values white lives above all others. The

most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen

in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in
Philadelphia.
