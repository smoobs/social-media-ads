Ad Text Hey what's up buds! Let's continue to preserve our history from substitution. It
is well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist.
Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all

soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white
soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance.
Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the
"racist" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until

1864 regardless of his skin color. Click to Learn More! #southunited South
