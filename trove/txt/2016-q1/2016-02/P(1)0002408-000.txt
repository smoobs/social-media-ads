Ad Text Unfortunately, the sudden death of the Supreme Court, Associate Justice
Antonin Scalia allows President Barack Obama to strengthen bases of his
tyranny, appointing a liberal candidate at the Supreme Court. We should not
allow him to put the judicial branch under his control.

Sign the petition that calls on the Congress to prevent the dangerous
appointment. And share this post please to promote this petition. Together we
can make America better!
