Ad Text After a Cleveland officer killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice in cold blood last
December and his family is still in mourning, the City has filed a creditor’s
Claim against the “estate” of the little boy. This is heartlessness in the highest

degree! Even though $500 is not so much to pay, suing them was useless
considering the fact that they were responsible for this calamity that came

upon this family.
