Ad Text Somali-American model Halima Aden is breaking all the records and people
mind’s as she slaying her hijab on the runway and the beauty pageant. She
became the first hijab-wearing model on IMG’s books. Aden was born in a
Kenyan refugee camp and move to America with her family when she was six-
years-old. She came through a lot and became a star, proving the very simple
statement “If you want something, you can achieve it”.
Her success is important not only because she overcame her past and
became successful, but also because she is making the statement to all the
haters in this country. Black girls can do anything!
