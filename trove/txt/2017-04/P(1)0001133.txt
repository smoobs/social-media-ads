Ad Text The truth hurts, but we must face it.
It's a sad fact, but the most of Black men regard women of other race
romantic and beautiful.
Believe me you, Black men, we got the most beautiful, romantic and attractive
females under the sun.
Value a Black woman and treat her like you'd treat other women of other
races and you'll realize how of a Queen you have.

Truth 11.0

Only Black girls see a man of their own
race that they're romantically interested
in and have to consider whether he
even likes Black girls
