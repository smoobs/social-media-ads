VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP
Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage
of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college
student during a traffic stop.
According to a police report; 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins was pulled over
near Lawrenceville for changing lines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face.
The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and
claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame.
This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law
enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation
is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they
admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY: TWO
GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER VID...
