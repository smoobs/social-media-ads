Ad Text "This was the clay of my high school graduation day 06-07-2015. My father

—was not there to see me walk and receive my diploma. That
day he was working like every other day of the week. He works in agricultural

farming, I am a Latina, my parents are Latinos working for the American
dream. I had to go to him so he can see all his hard work paying off. Giving
him my proof of what he has taught me. Your words don't have nothing
against his sweat."
