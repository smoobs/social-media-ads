Dope! Let's make this viral.

this is beautiful
A teacher at an elementary school in
SC wanted to help little boys with no
dad at home so he started a
"Gentleman's Club" where these little
guys dress up and learn to shake
hands, make eye contact, etc. He
even has extra jackets and ties for
boys who can't afford them.
