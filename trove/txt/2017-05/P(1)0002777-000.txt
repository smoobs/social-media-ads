Ad Text I believe Ron Paul’s position on our foreign military policy is absolutely right.
After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end
Obama’s policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
“We’re not going into Syria”, Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. I
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.

Here’s what Ron Paul thinks about it: “By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another “surge” in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.”

Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We’ve started the whole Afghanistan
thing to beat the Soviets, and no there’s no Soviet Union on the world map,
and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian
students.
