Ad Text If you also think that there should only be peace, come with us on June, 3 and
let's make it happen.

Stop war! Stop killing the innocent! Some believed Trump would withdraw the
US. from useless and bloody military campaigns. But what we see is only the
enhancement of hostility. We don't need wars no more! We want peace! It's
time for politicians to take care of the US. residents instead of fating them, as
well as other nationals, to death. We're organizing a peaceful gathering to
draw public attention to the above-mentioned terrible problem. Our President
and Congress must listen to those who granted them power - us, the people.
If you also think that there should only be peace, come with us and let's make
it happen.

Stop war! Stop killing the innocent! Make peace, not war! Make peace, not
war!
