allies have killed at least 3,200 civilians in more than 1,000 days of bombing?
Yes, it's more than nine times the 352 deaths acknowledged by the U.S.
military. Innocent Syrian civilians are dying for no reason, people in America
still suffer from unemployement, injustice and police brutality, but they still
spend money for bombing the Middle East.
