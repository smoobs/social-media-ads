Ad Text Putting all other things and reasons aside, bombing Syria could lead a huge

increase in number of refugees who would try to get to Europe and America.
May be it would be better for America if our government concentrates on

securing on borders and stops spending so much money on military
operations.

Some of our enemies are way Closer than Syria, so we need a wall to keep
them out! This should be a priority, not making refugee camps in Mexico
bigger and bigger by bombing Syria.
