Ad Text This is a call for love. This is a call for mercy. This is a call for compassion to
all those suffering in Syria now. For all the families who were forced out of
their homes, for the mothers who had to watch their sons and daughters
suffering, for the Children who are now orphans because of this terrible wicked
war. Words can’t heal their pain; our tears won’t bring back those who left us
already; nothing can console our grief right now. However, we have the duty
to save those whose lives are still at risk. For the sake of these people, we
have to work to end this terrible war. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen much
development in this direction. Bombing random targets and going for
momentary aims, taking reckless decisions and shifting our focus off crushing
terrorists only leads to more casualties among Civilians and creates even
more suffering. We have to stick to our agenda and work to protect people,
launching additional missiles on them won’t help. Pray for peace to return to
Syria and work sanely to bring this moment Closer!
