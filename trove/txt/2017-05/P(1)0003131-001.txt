This is a caJll for love: This is a call fur mercy. This is a call for mmpassion tn
all those suffering in Syria now. For all the families who were turned nut of
their homes, for the mnthem who had to watch their sons and daughters
suftarihg, fur the ct‘ti'ldren who are now nrphans because of this terrible
wicked war. Words can't heal their pain; our tears won't bring back those
who left us already; nothing can console our grief right now. Hnweuer, we
have the duh:r to save thus... 399 Mare
