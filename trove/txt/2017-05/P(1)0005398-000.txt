Ad Text In a recent interview, Barack Obama said that not bombing Syria “required
the most political courage”. He said that sending troops to Syria was a very
difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama
was hated for not taking actions, but it’s better for being hated for not killing
innocent people that for starting a useless war.

Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that
would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed.
Unfortunately, the recent government didn’t think twice, before they started
bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill
innocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?!
