Ad Text How can you bring peace to another nation when you have no peace in your
own country?
Someone help me understand this white man's tactics.
We talk about racism everywhere, but then in actual fact we talking about
inter-human relationship, international relations and seeing other humans as
equal and not inferiors.
This war has brought nothing positive and the poor, the masses, people of
color are the ones suffering.
Let this sink in!!
