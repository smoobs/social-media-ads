Ad Text If you don’t break the law, we are told, you have nothing to worry about from
cops.
Sadly, those who blindly repeat that phrase remain irresponsibly oblivious to
the real problem of police abusing innocent people.

kick in your door, strangle you, beat you, and force you to fill out a false
statement.
