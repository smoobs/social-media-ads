Ad Text The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for
2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget
of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany,
and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of
2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For
example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in
the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's
a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of highpowerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative
energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want
thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use
every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria.
