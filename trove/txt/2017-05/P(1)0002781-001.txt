Middle East wars are one of the reasons why we are in $33 trillion debt
today. We could have solved thousands or economic and security problems
by simply rejecting the aggressive military yzruolio'j.r we’ve been having for 3o

long. Iraq war didn‘t IF'IIE'I terrorism. and didn't solve Th9 Islamization problem.

If we repeat “the same war in Syria, we‘ll only got the same result: no profit
for American citizens. and several thousands of dead American soldiers.
Globalism. terrorists and Corporations are the only.r ones who benefit from oil
wars.
