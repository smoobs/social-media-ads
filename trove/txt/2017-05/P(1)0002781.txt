Ad Text Middle East wars are one of the reasons why we are in $20 trillion debt today.
We could have solved thousands of economic and security problems by
simply rejecting the aggressive military policy we've been having for so long.
Iraq war didn't end terrorism, and didn't solve the Islamization problem. If we
repeat the same war in Syria, we'll only get the same result: no profit for
American citizens and several thousands of dead American soldiers.
Globalists, terrorists and Corporations are the only ones who benefit from oil
wars.
