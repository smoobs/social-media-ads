Ad Text Ah indigenous woman will be running for president of Mexico in 2018. Mexico
hasn't have an indigenous president since Benito Juarez and that was over
130 years ago. The indigenous communities that are part of the National
Indigenous Congress decided to struggle collectively, for another way of
doing politics and for the right to live. I hope her policy will be the opposite of
the US. policy, which does not spare its citizens and sends them to fight in

the Middle East to satisfy their political ambitions. Source: —
