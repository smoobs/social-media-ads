Wow! What a great surprise for young black ballerinas from the south side of
Chicago! We mean it's the greatest surprise ever possible! Misty Copeland is
more than ballerina! She symbolizes black excellence in dancing and ballet.
Her example is inspiring. Misty's success tells all the black kids that we can
achieve the greatness in occupations where our people have been absent for
centuries! Misty teaches us that there is nothing impossible for a black person
if we work and study hard! Thank you, Misty! Thank you, Steve Harvey! This
video is touching. Wow! What a great surprise for young black ballerinas from
