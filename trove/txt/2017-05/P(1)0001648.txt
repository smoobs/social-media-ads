Ad Text Explosion in Manchester, ISIS attack in Marawi, bomb attack in Bangkok, car
bombing in Syria — all happened in one day. This is heartbreaking and we are
praying for everyone.
Don't you think that it is vicious cycle? Now they will bomb more in Syria to
stop terrorists. And then another bombing here and there. But these attacks
cant bring Peace.
Stop wasting money on weapons. America; you better stay away from this
and start taking care of your own people. Within your own country.
