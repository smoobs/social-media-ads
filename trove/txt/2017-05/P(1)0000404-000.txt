Ad Text If you don't want refugees, stop creating them! Hands off Syria!
Please, come out to support us on June 3rd in front of Trump Tower in New
York. We must stop this madness! Some believed Trump would withdraw the
US. from useless and bloody military campaigns. But what we see is only the
enhancement of hostility. We don't need wars no more! We want peace! It's
time for politicians to take care of the US. residents instead of fating them, as
well as other nationals, to death.

We're organizing a peaceful gathering to draw public attention to the above-
mentioned terrible problem. Our President and Congress must listen to those
who granted them power - us, the people. If you also think that there should
only be peace, come with us and let's make it happen.

Stop war! Stop killing the innocent! Make peace, not war! Make peace, not
war!
