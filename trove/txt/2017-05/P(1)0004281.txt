After receiving the comment "you don't
belong in this country you f**ing joke,"
actor Kai Penn launched a fundraiser in the
commenter's honor: "Donating to Syrian
Refugees in the Name of the Dude Who
Said I Don't Belong in America." His
initial goal was set at $2,500; the event
raised over $8501,000 in just 3 days.
