Ad Text This is the story about 19-year-old Juwan Alexander Plummer.
On April 14 the Plummers' door had been kicked in by burglars.
On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see
the police lights because the unit was parked down the road.
Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his
Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection.
When Plummer went to the door, the scared kid fired a warning shot to fend
off the would-be burglars.
However, the shotgun blast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.
