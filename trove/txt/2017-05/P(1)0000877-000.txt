Ad Text Mexicans are known for their masculinity and militancy, as many wars in the
past say. That's why the US often offers Mexicans to join the armed forces, in
exchange for what they promise to give American Citizenship. In this regard,
Mexicans are often sent to the war zone in Syria or other countries, from
where they sometimes do not return. Many Mexicans have to go for it, as
today the process of obtaining American Citizenship can last for years and
even dozens of years. The US policy towards Mexicans is becoming
increasingly brutal, therefore, it is necessary to stop any attempts by the US
government to send Mexicans to the war zones, where they fight for any
unknown goals.
