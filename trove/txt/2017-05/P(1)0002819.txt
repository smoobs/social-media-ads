Ad Text WOW!An off-duty Los Angeles cop in Anaheim called a female student a
"cunt" for stepping on his lawn as she walked back home from school. When
her friend stood up for her, the cop started a fight with kids, pulled a gun and
fired a shot near the 13-year-old boy. Is this starting to become a trend now?
